## Meeting Notes for kickoff meeting on 7/12

`Note: This is just a place holder for the full notes to be updated later`

A number of initiatives were discussed during the meetings.

### Schedule :

It was decided regular meetups should be done third thursday of every month. The challenge of course was to ensure that there is reasonable content that could be presented to make it worthy of interest of people to attend the regular meetups. Ideas were elicited about what could be the nature of content people could present. Satyajit (and ???) were appointed the primary coordinators for the meetup scheduling and deciding on the content

### Group project

The group decided to start a project that various people could collectively work upon. Navin suggested creating a Pune Startups directory which was agreed upon as the first project to work on.

### Mailing List

It was decided to continue with the current [pythonpune google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pythonpune). There was some discussion on the current posting policy and we decided to continue with the existing policy. ie. some specific relevance to python was required. Also to not allow job postings or posting about other non python related events etc.
