## Meeting Notes for kickoff meeting on 7/12

The December 7th meetup was attended by a healthy crowd of 20+ member and students of SICSR. 


### Topics Of Discussion:

Although Dec 7th meetup was the 3rd meetup of it’s kind held by the pune python 
group, it was held after a long period of absence. The meetup started off 
with a general round of introduction and pleasantries. 

The First question was raised by Navin Kabra. <br>
Ques: In a programming language based group’s(like pune-python) meetup what actually 
is done and  how to sustain a group like this? 

Saager Mhatre, an active member of Pune java group - said meetups are mainly for 
knowledge gathering and knowledge sharing purpose, a meetup is a place where like minded
people come together and have talks and discussions.<br>
Saager Mhatre pointed out that meeting people is easy but convincing them to give a talk 
is the challenge. To sustain a group like this and to have it happy and 
successful, members would have to share the burden of being mediators and coordinators. 

Based on this, a general motion was raised to decide

* What things can be done to make the group more vibrant?
* Which member(s) shall take responsibility for which task(s)? 

#### 1. Activities the group would organize:

* Python related talks and tutorials:<br>
	The talks will be of two types: Beginner level and Advance level.

				Python tutorials and introductory talk for the python 
				beginners and fresher </td>

		choice to work on. The venue would be organized by the user group.
	3. Bug bash: Take a open source project or library and solve as many 
		bugs as possible

	Dhananjay Nene and Saager Mhatre have volunteered to try and organise at least one

	Dhananjay Nene raised a motion to have a one whole day Python bash in the month of March. 
	The motion was accepted by the group present and further discussions would be carried out on an email thread.

	under the banner of Python startup. The motion was accepted by 
	the group present and two projects were also suggested
 
	1. Pune Python website:  lead by Dhananjay Nene and Palak Mathur
	2. Online Directory of major-minor start-up companies lead by Navin Kabra


	By vote of Popularity :) **Satyajit Ranjeev** was
	appointed as the coordinator of meetup for the Pune Python group.


#### 2. Job Posting and Moderations on the google group:

Dhananjay Nene raised a motion to block job postings in the group. After 
much discussion it was decided that no job postings will be tolerated on 
the google group.
Further moderation rule was also added. No post other than Python related
shall be posted on the group

For convenience in moderation it was decided that, if a signed document 
is given to any of the  moderators than that member will be exempted from
moderation. The Nature of the document and process of submission 
is still open for discussion on the mailing list. 

As requested by Dhananjay Nene the number of moderator have been increased, from 
now onwards **Sushrut Bidwai, Mandar Vaze** and **Aditya Laghate** are the 
new moderators of the Group.

A general motion was raised stating how often and the next time the group 
should meet? <br>
It was decided that the group will meet every month and the meetup up will happen 
tentatively on a thursday in the third week of the month. This is still open for 
discussion on the mailing list as there are members who prefer weekends.


####4. Mailing List or Google Group.

Satyajit Ranjeev had raised a motion to convert the google group to simply 
a mailing list, citing fears of a possible shutdown of google groups by 
Google Inc. The motion was rejected by the group or say indefinitely postponed 
stating we’ll cross this bridge when we get there. we will continue with the 
current [pythonpune google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pythonpune). 


####5. Separate student stream.

A general motion was raised to have a separate stream of events for students 
and freshers. The motion was accepted by the group. Events and talks for students 
will be held on the same day but one hour prior to the appointed times. 


####6. Meetup.com Sponsership
If anyone is willing to sponsor membership of meetup.com for

###Conclusion:

All in all the Dec-7 meetup was a great success. The response was 
overwhelming and enthusiasm shown by the community, for the community was 
immense. Hope this continues. lets make the pune python group one of the 
best in the country
